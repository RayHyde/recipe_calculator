Recipe Calculator

This handy calculator recalculates your recipe to a new size of cake tin or other number of persons

It is not a plugin, just an html page with LESS/CSS, a jQuery script and some images.

It has a fun retro look, is responsive and the index.html automatically redirects to the Dutch version of the page if your browser is set to windmill, cheese and wooden shoes compatibility mode.
