<h3 style="color: tomato">Recipe Calculator</h3>

<p>This handy calculator recalculates your recipe to a new size of cake tin or other number of persons. <br><br>

It is not a plugin, just an html page with LESS/CSS, a jQuery script and some images.<br><br>

It has a fun retro look, is responsive and the index.html automatically redirects to the Dutch version of the page if your browser is set to windmill, cheese and wooden shoes compatibility mode. </p>
